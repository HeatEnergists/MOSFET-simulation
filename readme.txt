Actually, I only modified three files: The gmsh_mos2d.py, simple_physics.py and simple_dd. But for convenience, I put all the required files in here.
You can modify relative paths to run them. And you can also overwrite them with the original code of the software 
(please rest assured that the original version is commented in the files I modified, you don't need to worry about losing the original version of the code).
